# 🏥 Heart Disease Prediction – RAMP Challenge

## 📌 Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Accurate and early diagnosis of heart disease is crucial for effective treatment and prevention. The goal of this challenge is to build predictive models that classify whether a patient has heart disease based on clinical and diagnostic features.

The target variable **y** is binary:
- **y = 1**: The patient has heart disease.
- **y = 0**: The patient does not have heart disease.

Automating this classification process could significantly aid healthcare professionals in making quick and reliable diagnoses.

## 🎯 Challenge Objective

Participants will build machine learning models to classify patients as having heart disease or not, based on structured clinical data. The goal is to maximize classification performance while ensuring interpretability and clinical relevance.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

Models will be evaluated using:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-score**
- **ROC-AUC Score**

The final ranking will be based on a weighted combination of these metrics.
